Covid certificate check for employees - sample repository

Concept of COVID-19 Check related to the “obligation to work from home and entering SAP’s workplaces” requirement.

Disclaimers: 
- The author does not have a complete picture of all functional / non-functional requirements of the solution, e.g., legal requirements
- The concept is not meant to compete with the Microsoft PowerApps based solution built for the SAP Pandemic Taskforce.
- The concept tries to implement an easier workflow for the end-users of the solution (SAP employees, Pandemic Taskforce staff) than provided with the MS PowerApps based solution).

# Motivation:

The current COVID-19 pandemic has a big impact and implications on everyone’s personal life. Changing regulations and rules demand flexibility and often require new ways of doing things.
But this does not stop in private life, frequently changing legal regulations have to implemented by enterprises and institutions on short notice making it hard to come up with nicely automated solutions that integrate with enterprise’s often complex IT-environments; not to forget compliance and data protection requirements.
Sounds like a promising and compelling use case for testing a Low Code / No Code approach, doesn’t it?
